# passwordGenerator

## The Repository

Repository was created to build a webpage with the ability to generate a passwork based off user inputs. User had the options to choose a password length from 8 to 128 characters as well as the use of four different types of characters.

## Challenges

The logic of the while loop was difficult to lock down initially. While loops need to be in place to ensure users enters valid responses to the prompt and the confirm commands. Difficulties included maintaining the loop until conditions were correct and choosing the correct condition to maintain the loop.
